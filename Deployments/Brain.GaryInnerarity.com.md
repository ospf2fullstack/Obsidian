I use Obsidian for my second brain. If you're reading this, it's hosted on Obsidian, by Obsidian. There's an awesome GraphQL db connecting every word, document, photo, etc... uploaded to this site by Obsidian. In my professional life, that's called a Thread, but in my personal space, we'll coin it as a second brain. 

Follow the linkage, or click here [[Obsidian]] to read about Obsidian more. 

For now, the architecture is VERY simple. I maintain versions of my web app (file repository) in [[Github]]  and I subscribe to [[Obsidian Publish]] to host my web app. When it's published, it's displayed and distributed around the world using CloudFlare for various functions, but the only information you need to know is that it's being used for the DNS record(s).
