# What is BIM?
An acronym for Building Information Modeling/Management. In brief, it's the digital twins that multiple tenants utilize to collaborate on the successful delivery of a building, or construction project. 

## Current Methods
It's currently industry method to utilize tools like Laser scanners, [[photogrammetry]], manual documentation, electrical panel schematics, and any other form of diagram previously developed by CAD departments or architects to plan the assembly of massive building orchestrations. 


# What are the current methods used in BIM collection? 
1. 3D Laser Scanning (3D CAD)
2. 2D Laser Scanning (2D CAD)
3. Schematics for pluming, Wiring, HVAC, etc.. 
4. Architectural designs 
But there's not a lot for as-built, unless you look into the on-going collection process that utilizes 3D laser scanning and other tools like photogrammetry which is often used in bridge inspections and building inspections.

# What type of data does a Building Information Model posses? 
- Schematics
- System Manuals
- Issues/Tasks associated with an area/component
- Measurements
- System Meta Data (electrical values, nut types, etc..)
- Blueprints
- CAD (2d/3D)
- Excel sheets of asset metadata
- Hand drawn layouts
- Software as a Service platforms (NetBox for rack management and documentation)

# Goals
- Automate Building Information Collection allowing the human to verify and assign. 
- Visualize BIM data quicker with fewer human hours involved
- Lower the cost of entry for the initial ingestion cycle when onboarding a new client site. 
- Optimized for low touch collection, reducing the needs for clearances, training, tethering, and so much more that goes into being authorized to enter a space. 

# Challenges & Constraints
- Photo to Mesh quality for collection to model is not up to par without human interaction. There are some great platforms, but workflow is not documented; along with there being a lack of automated workflow. (upload thousands of photos and let the computer take over)
- NeRF technology recently released with no true workflow practiced. Generative AI uses photos to "fill the gaps" for photogrammetry - accuracy is the winner with this one. 
- AI for object segmentation has been around, but no good workflow developed. Object segmentation is useful for providing modelers with a singular object out of the gate to work with rather than attempting to segment billions of points for each little object they may need. 
- AI for text identification and correlation has no workflow, but the technology is prominent. This will be helpful for capturing asset tags, qr codes, hand-written text, etc...
- Lack of a data catalog for CAD/Modeling to easily find all of the necessary data they need when modeling. All photos, scans, videos should be searchable by meta data and image detection (ai). Something along the lines of Google image search where you can upload a reference image and it'll populate where that source is from and high confidence matches. 
- Collection times require extensive planning, expensive hardware/software, and long processing times with manual experienced human interaction.
