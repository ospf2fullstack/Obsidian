# What is BIM?
An acronym for Building Information Modeling/Management. In brief, it's the digital twins that multiple tenants utilize to collaborate on the successful delivery of a building, or construction project. 

## Current Methods
It's currently industry method to utilize tools like Laser scanners, [[photogrammetry]], manual documentation, electrical panel schematics, and any other form of diagram previously developed by CAD departments or architects to plan the assembly of massive building orchestrations. 


# What are the current methods used in BIM collection? 
1. 3D Laser Scanning (3D CAD)
2. 2D Laser Scanning (2D CAD)
3. Schematics for pluming, Wiring, hvac, etc.. 
4. Architectural designs 
But there's not a lot for as-built, unless you look into the on-going collection process that utilizes 3D laser scanning and other tools like photogrammetry which is often used in bridge inspections and building inspections.

# What are some of the challenges? 
Human interactions are necessary at each phase for traditional collection methods. 

# What type of data does a Building Information Model posses? 
- Schematics
- System Manuals
- Issues/Tasks associated with an area/component
- Measurements
- System Meta Data (electrical values, nut types, etc..)
- Blueprints
- CAD (2d/3D)

# Goals
- Automate Building Information Collection allowing the human to verify and assign. 
- Visualize BIM data quicker with fewer human hours involved
- Lower the cost of entry for the initial ingestion cycle when onboarding a new client site. 
- Optimized for low touch collection, reducing the needs for clearances, training, tethering, and so much more that goes into being authorized to enter a space. 

# Contraints
- Photo to Mesh quality for collection to model is not up to par without human interaction
- NeRF technology recently released with no true workflow practiced
- AI for object segmentation has been around, but no good workflow developed.
- AI for text identification and correlation has no workflow, but the technology is prominent. 
- Lack of a data catalog for CAD/Modeling to easily find all of the necessary data they need when modeling.
