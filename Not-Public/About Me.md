# generational history
A single mother, early in life, raised two children just three years apart. Both of which aggressively passionate about life and learning. Decades and generations of (drug, sexual, physical and mental) abuse, poverty and shitty mindsets were not forked on this branch that I refactored. Unfortunately, the abuse is not entirely vanished; it was merely engineered out of this branch when I turned 18. My once role model and competitive counterpart, Meaghan is still under the influence by the dark web. 

Father runs to steal from neighbors...

# Elementary
Being in 2nd street elementary...haunted... and bay middle school, no parental supervision riding bikes around bay st. louis..., selling drugs, stealing cigars, drinking sparks, fishing, attempting to vandalize every chance we had... smoking weed and fishing more...
# Middle School 
Daily fights in the restrooms of bay middle, nurses giving kids medicine without supervision, which we would turn around and sell. 

MS friend telling me about how he would swallow gum bc he wasn't fed at home...

"hot boxed" on school nights with my sister and her friends in RV's before Katrina and FEMA trailers after Katrina. Same crowd, would find abandoned homes to have sex parties where everyone would drink and fuck in different rooms. 

I was told to "never bring the police to my door" by my mother and I stuck with it. There were MANY run ins with the police and because I looked innocent, even when I was the one selling or stirring shit up, I would be told to "take a hike" while my friends got left behind to deal with the police. 

# High School
High school... found a mentor that guided me, had to feed myself. Worked nearly every day after school, leaving no time for homework but still passed, was band president, got $42k/yr to attend Loyola, couldn't afford the commute so I went to ULL - started a fraternity, moved to SELU (SLU), started a business, tanked it, spent the next 8 years recovering and learning lots of life lessons and technical content. Rouses 5 strong years.

# College 
Obtained my BS Psychology and MBA:IT along with 9 other certifications during that time. 

# Career
Was invited to speak at conferences, planned them, hosted websites for friends, conducted several audits for clients on their technical systems. Spent 5 years operating a marine parts distributor, started a video game cafe - again, dabbled in wood working. Migrated 24 physical servers down to 3 (from those 24). Rebuilt the core switches on a 20 building campus network bymyself - minus an emergency call to a vendor to tell me to `enable ip route` on the cisco switch. Migrated all surveillance on that campus for $14k, negotiated every software contract down to 50% of its original cost.

I'm not sure I was meant to have this 'normal' life that I live now with my wife and daughter.
