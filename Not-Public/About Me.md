You found me. The Technologist that achieved unthinkable outcomes for the efforts that were...

A single mother, early in life, raised two children just three years apart. Both of which aggressively passionate about life and learning. Decades and generations of (drug, sexual, physical and mental) abuse, poverty and shitty mindsets were not forked on this branch that I refactored. Unfortunately, the abuse is not entirely vanished; it was merely engineered out of this branch when I turned 18. My once role model and competitive counterpart, Meaghan is still under the influence by the dark web. 

Father runs to steal from neighbors...

Being in 2nd street elementary...haunted... and bay middle school, no parental supervision riding bikes around bay st. louis..., selling drugs, stealing cigars, drinking sparks, fishing, attempting to vandalize every chance we had... smoking weed and fishing more...

Daily fights in the restrooms of bay middle, nurses giving kids medicine without supervision, which we would turn around and sell. 

MS friend telling me about how he would swallow gum bc he wasn't fed at home...

High school... found a mentor that guided me, had to feed myself. Worked nearly every day after school, leaving no time for homework but still passed, was band president, got $42k/yr to attend Loyola, couldn't afford the commute so I went to ULL - started a fraternity, moved to SELU (SLU), started a business, tanked it, spent the next 8 years recovering and learning lots of life lessons and technical content. 

Obtained my BS Psychology and MBA:IT along with 9 other certifications during that time. Was invited to speak at conferences, planned them, hosted websites for friends, conducted several audits for clients on their technical systems. Spent 5 years operating a marine parts distributor, started a video game cafe - again, dabbled in wood working. Migrated 24 physical servers down to 3 (from those 24). Rebuilt the core switches on a 20 building campus network bymyself - minus an emergency call to a vendor to tell me to `enable ip route` on the cisco switch. Migrated all surveillance on that campus for $14k, negotiated every software contract down to 50% of its original cost.
