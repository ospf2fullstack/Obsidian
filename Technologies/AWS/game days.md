# Game Days
Game days are meant to provide you and the team quality time to review, implement and TEST the procedures in your ever-changing workloads. 

One example would be backups and recovery. There should be well-aligned procedures detailing the necessary steps to backup, locate the backup, identify the backup and recover the backup (to a non-prod env). These steps should be clearly detailed and each member of the team should be able to perform those steps.
