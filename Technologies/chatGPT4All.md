# chatGPT4All
![[Pasted image 20230624134329.png]]
I had a lot of fun discovering what chatGPT4All can do for me as [[LLM]]  for my personal notes. The one thing I like most about this approach is that my notes are "fact" as I studied - not filled with various miss-information sources, typo's etc... outside of what I wrote. 

I would really like to keep using this as a sideloaded application for my Obsidian notes. The built in Obsidian search works, but it's not "great" in my opinion. This turns simple search into accurate questioning, but I love that! It'll force me to adjust my rhetoric for a more complex question that should render highly accurate results from my personally maintained set of data! Which is the best part. 

## Install chatGPT4All
Grab some popcorn, take a few head ache meds, and get ready... this one is only for the strong. 

Just kidding, it'll take about 38 seconds to setup. 
1.  Navigate: [chatGPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/index.html)
2. Download [Windows, Linux, MacOS](https://gpt4all.io/index.html)
3. Execute the .exe, .run, or .dmg after the download is completed. 

## Configure chatGPT4All
Now that chatGPT4All is installed, you need to tell it where your directory (folder) of files are located. 

1. Open the cog wheel
2. Navigate to 'LocalDocs Plugin (BETA)', Beta may be removed in future releases. 
3. Browse for your folder containing all of your files
4. Add a collection name to that browsed to folder/directory and "Add", when done. 

Give the engine about 30 minutes to train itself.
