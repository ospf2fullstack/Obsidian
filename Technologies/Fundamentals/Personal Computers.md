Personal Computers, tablets, phones, and nearly anything else that we interact with could be considered a personal computer. It's comprised of these fundamental technologies: 
1. Motherboard/Control Board
2. Processing Unit
3. RAM (Random Access Memory)
4. Storage (Hard Drive/ Solid State)
5. (optional) Video Card (Graphics Card)

Each category has an entire market dedicated to them, but for a fundamental note, most systems are comprised of these components. When you're first troubleshooting as a newer engineer, you can focus on replacing these components first. Then, as you progress and become a specialist engineer, you'll want to deep dive into why that particular component failed - saving costs on repair by fixing micro components instead of the main component as a whole.
