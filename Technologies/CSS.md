# CSS

Once you have your [[HTML]] looking pretty with CSS, you can then throw in some [[JavaScript]] to animate it and control the user experience even more with interactivity! 

## Link Stylesheet
```html
<!-- the href is the path to the local .css file you use to style your html -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```
