Anycubic is not an American company. They are a Chinese held manufacturer that produces high quality 

I own the Anycubic Photo Mono 4K  with the wash and cure station, imaged below:

What's really nice about this setup, is that you can put anything on the build plate and your time will only be extended if the additional objects are taller, rather than wider without extending the time of print. 

My other printer is the Anycubic Kobra Max. It has an enormous build plate.

It's not the fastest printer on the market, but from an economical standpoint, it's 100% worth the money you spend on it.
