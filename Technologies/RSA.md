# RSA
## NIST Standards
NIST currently, at the time of this note, recommends [SP 800-133 rev. 2](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-133/rev-2/final), this specific publication is the recommendation for Cryptographic Key Generation. 

It's currently recommended, since 1977, to use the RSA algorithm with [[Asymmetric]] encryption (key pairs). 

It's important to know if you're looking for a [[Symmetric]] vs [[Asymmetric]] Encryption. 

## ![[Symmetric]]
## ![[Asymmetric]]

>[!tip]
>RSA encryption and decryption does have a [[Performance]] hit, but as previously known, it is estimated to take 1500 years to crack the 768-bit version where the current release supports 1024-2048-bit key lengths. 
>This algorithm may be a round for a while.
