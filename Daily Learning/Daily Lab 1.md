Today, I'm learning how to advance my k8s[[Kubernetes (k8s)]] understanding of networking[[Networking]]. 
1. How it's designed
2. Building my mental map of each service
3. How to get a pod to be publically accessible

I'm also running a mile tonight, so I need to make sure I don't kill my PC before my release.
