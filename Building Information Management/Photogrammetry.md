One of the best applications available for [Photogrammetry](https://www.capturingreality.com/)

It's a great professional tool and consumer tool. The best part, you don't have to pay until you're happy! 

It even supports combining [[Point Clouds]] as a component to create a measurement accurate 3D mesh with texture. Potentially reducing the demand on CAD and ART when trying to deliver a product. 

Here's a sample of PolyCam that I used to create a photogrammetric model of Taj Mahal:

Another one of my exterior light. If you're just needing a quick object, this method works wonders in bind.
