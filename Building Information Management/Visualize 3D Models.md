One of my favorite methods of visualizing my 3D models is with the recently released version of Model Viewer by Google. 
https://modelviewer.dev/ 

You can use [[Point Clouds]] to accurately measure objects in build in wide areas and compact areas and then combine [[Photogrammetry]] to output a finalized 3D model with little/no need to pass CAD/Art for objects that don't have a core function. 

I'll provide instructions on how to use this in an index.html file later...
