# Metrology 
I do this professionally. As a technologist with a history of laser scanning, photogrammetry and strong desired to figure IT out - it would be an understatement to say I'm obsessed with my profession. 

These public notes may include some high-level techniques and gotchas that I have learned along the way, but remember, it's high level and not inclusive of my actual work professionally. For example, I use $1,000 equipment for my hobby captures. At work, I use equipment that costs more than $100,000... :) 

# Automate [[Point Clouds]] Processing/Registration
... I'll update this soon. 

# Mesh Generation with [[Photogrammetry]]
To date, my favorite tools are [PolyCam](https://poly.cam/) and [Luma AI](https://lumalabs.ai/). Hands down the best on the market for a quick capture, cloud processed and easily distributed project files. 

Specifically, Luma AI is doing work with the [[NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields)]] technology... Check it out.
